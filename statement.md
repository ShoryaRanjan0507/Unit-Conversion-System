# Project Statement – Unit Conversion System

* Problem Statement
In everyday situations, people frequently need to convert values such as length, weight, or temperature. Performing these conversions manually can lead to confusion and mistakes especially when converting between
multiple units. Therefore, there is a need for a simple automated system that can convert values quickly and accurately.

# Scope of the Project
This project focuses on creating a basic menu driven Python program that performs unit conversions in three major categories: length, weight, and temperature. It allows the user to enter a value and receive the
converted result instantly. The system runs in a console environment and is intended for single-user use.

# Target Users
- Students
- General users who need quick conversions
- Anyone learning Python or computational thinking

# High-Level Features
- Menu based navigation
- Length conversion (km ↔ m ↔ cm)
- Weight conversion (kg ↔ g)
- Temperature conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Easy to use text based interface
